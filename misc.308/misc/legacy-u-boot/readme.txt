those u-boot binaries were provided by i think google (i do not have
the orignal links around any more) to boot legacy kernels via u-boot

in my experience with snow it is possible to boot legacy kernels with
those but no mainline kernels and it is not possible to boot legacy
kernels with mainline u-boot, but mainline kernels and u-boot works
